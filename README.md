# How to Run

(Dependencies!)

- you need yarn!

1. cd into /backend folder.
2. run "yarn dev-go" command. this will concurrently run client react and backend server.
3. to use the database locally, you'll need to be on the project's IP whitelist (contact me if ur a collaborator and I can do that).
